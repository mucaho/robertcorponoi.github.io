We\'ve all been at this point at one time or another in our careers but if you can really say you have not then I\'ll post my resume at the bottom and await your call. But seriously, it\'s a frustrating position to be in because its something you have to do but you might feel like you\'re not learning or using anything that is useful for future endeavors. I\'ve been in this scenario multiple times before and it took me a while to learn how to become content with it and maybe I can help someone else in the same situation. Now of course this advice won\'t apply to every single instance but it might help you see a different point of view.</p>\n<h2 id="meet-the-contenders"><a href="#meet-the-contenders" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Meet The Contenders</h2>\n<p>So in order to make this more personal I\'ll use a personal experience of mine. If you\'ve read or seen any work I\'ve done, you\'ll know im a lover of JavaScript both on the font and back end. On the other end of that, there is my archnemesis, PHP. Now before the PHP squad comes after me, I am NOT saying that PHP is a terrible language. I am simply stating that PHP is not a language I like to work with for various reasons. In fact with JavaScript I tend to use TypeScript whenever I can and I feel that PHP isn\'t always strict enough for me but that\'s besides the point. I\'ve written plenty of PHP in my lifetime so far and will continue to write much more because the web is still mostly PHP and that probably won\'t change for a while. I mean heck, if IE can hang on for life for so long anything can.</p>\n<h2 id="different-languages-similar-structure"><a href="#different-languages-similar-structure" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Different Languages, Similar Structure</h2>\n<p>One of the biggest things that I found to help me with this situation might seem obvious but it\'s not always easy to apply, finding a link between the two languages. Put simply, this means that you need to find how doing something in the language you don\'t like (in my case PHP) can help you advance your knowledge for the language/s you do like (in my case JavaScript). For me this became easier with ES6 because of the class syntax with JavaScript so at least I was using OOP in both languages. Another thing for me was strict typing. I became very attached to strict typing in Typescript and had to look up how to apply that in PHP. In PHP strict typing is optional and you have to declare it at the top of the file and even then you don\'t have to specify parameter types but of course I did anyways. PHP is still very much lacking in strict typings such as class properties but slowly those features are being added. This is the single biggest tip that I can offer because if you find a way to indirectly advance your knowledge about a language or technology by not working on it you\'ll be much happier with your current situtation.</p>\n<h2 id="incorporating-it-into-your-stack"><a href="#incorporating-it-into-your-stack" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Incorporating It Into Your Stack</h2>\n<p>Ok now hear me out, I know this post is about languages and technologies you don\'t enjoy but there is some value to incorporating the said language and technology into your stack. Now the initial benefits to this are almost none, as at this point you still don\'t enjoy it but in the long term you are looking at making yourself a more valuable asset to future employers and in the end making more money. You never know, if you dedicate yourself and learn the nuances of whatever it is you may grow to discover that you like it. I myself am halfway through this step, I realize that a lot of the web still relies on PHP and in some cases it really is a good choice so if I know it I can be a more valuable asset in the future.</p>\n<h2 id="recreate-projects"><a href="#recreate-projects" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Recreate Projects</h2>\n<p>This tip is similar to the first tip but it involves a little bit more work because you have to write something in both languages. Let\'s say that at work I\'m tasked with creating a testing framework in PHP (obviously I would never do because there are already great and reliable open source frameworks available for any language). Now after creating it at work, I go home and work on creating the same thing but in JavaScript. This idea takes something that you made in something you are less comfortable in lets you see how you can do with creating it in a language that is more natural to you. It\'s quite a fun project and I\'ve done before (with JavaScript to Python) and while it\'s technically double the work, you end up with a feeling of satisfaction.</p>\n<h2 id="look-elsewhere"><a href="#look-elsewhere" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Look Elsewhere</h2>\n<p>This is the least recommended step unless you are sure that you have exhausted almost everything you can possibly learn in your current position. If you\'ve been somewhere for less than a year you really should consider one of the methods above and stay for the experience because it will make you more valuable to future employees and you can still learn a lot more. However, in the end this is an option and you could look for other employement using the tech stack that you are comfortable with.</p>\n<h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>In the end it is up to you how you deal with this situation and the above methods are just things that I have found to be useful throughout my career.

I used to think that I was alone with this feeling because it really doesn\'t get brought up much (maybe people think it makes them look like weaker developers?) but after reading <a href="https://davidwalsh.name/conquering-impostor-syndrome" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">David Walsh\'s amazing post</a> on it and talking about it with another developer I knew I had to share my experiences with it.</p>\n<h2 id="what-imposter-syndrome-is-to-me"><a href="#what-imposter-syndrome-is-to-me" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>What Imposter Syndrome Is To Me</h2>\n<p>Overall everyone has the same general feeling from imposter syndrome, you just don\'t feel like you\'re a good enough developer. It can make you feel like there\'s no use in starting new projects or finishing old ones and it can even make you feel like quitting entirely sometimes and give up on development. I\'ve experienced imposter syndrom many times and there have been a couple times where I really felt down and actually did give up development for a few months and while it freed me of the feeling for a bit I ultimately came back because it\'s what I love doing.</p>\n<h2 id="when-does-it-occur"><a href="#when-does-it-occur" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>When Does It Occur</h2>\n<p>For me, I can almost always pinpoint the origin of my feelings with imposter syndrome to some form of social media. I don\'t mean just Facebook and Twitter, I\'m talking about Reddit and Github and StackOverflow (yes I know they\'re not technically social media but nonetheless we\'ll simplify it). Sometimes when I look at what other people have accomplished, and then I look at what I\'m working on, I feel inferior. I start thinking to myself, \'Wow, this guy/girl made a framework that\'s used by thousands of people\' and it starts to set in that maybe I\'m not as good of a developer as I thought I was. Even when looking at projects that are completely out of my scope or stack such as what the Boring Company or the Alphabet Company is working on it makes me feel like what I\'m working on is almost trivial.</p>\n<h2 id="how-to-move-past-it"><a href="#how-to-move-past-it" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>How To Move Past It</h2>\n<p>Getting over imposter syndrome is not always an easy thing. This is because it can make you feel unmotivated and you might lose desire to work on things but I have found that the absolute best way to get rid of the feeling is to work through it. It doesn\'t matter how you work through it, create something simple, learn a new programming language, learn a new technology, etc. You have to work through it and give yourself a win to realize that you are a good developer with your own strengths and you shouldn\'t compare yourself to others. In the end you have to realize that while there are better developers than you out there, they are not you. You have your own unique skillset that you bring to the table that nobody else can.</p>\n'}}]}}}}}}]);
