I used to think that I was alone with this feeling because it really doesn\'t get brought up much (maybe people think it makes them look like weaker developers?) but after reading <a href="https://davidwalsh.name/conquering-impostor-syndrome" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">David Walsh\'s amazing post</a> on it and talking about it with another developer I knew I had to share my experiences with it.</p>\n<h2 id="what-imposter-syndrome-is-to-me"><a href="#what-imposter-syndrome-is-to-me" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>What Imposter Syndrome Is To Me</h2>\n<p>Overall everyone has the same general feeling from imposter syndrome, you just don\'t feel like you\'re a good enough developer. It can make you feel like there\'s no use in starting new projects or finishing old ones and it can even make you feel like quitting entirely sometimes and give up on development. I\'ve experienced imposter syndrome many times and there have been a couple times where I really felt down and actually did give up development for a few months and while it freed me of the feeling for a bit I ultimately came back because it\'s what I love doing.</p>\n<h2 id="when-does-it-occur"><a href="#when-does-it-occur" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>When Does It Occur</h2>\n<p>For me, I can almost always pinpoint the origin of my feelings with imposter syndrome to some form of social media. I don\'t mean just Facebook and Twitter, I\'m talking about Reddit and Github and StackOverflow (yes I know they\'re not technically social media but nonetheless we\'ll simplify it). Sometimes when I look at what other people have accomplished, and then I look at what I\'m working on, I feel inferior. I start thinking to myself, \'Wow, this guy/girl made a framework that\'s used by thousands of people\' and it starts to set in that maybe I\'m not as good of a developer as I thought I was. Even when looking at projects that are completely out of my scope or stack such as what the Boring Company or the Alphabet Company is working on it makes me feel like what I\'m working on is almost trivial.</p>\n<h2 id="how-to-move-past-it"><a href="#how-to-move-past-it" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>How To Move Past It</h2>\n<p>Getting over imposter syndrome is not always an easy thing. This is because it can make you feel unmotivated and you might lose desire to work on things but I have found that the absolute best way to get rid of the feeling is to work through it. It doesn\'t matter how you work through it, create something simple, learn a new programming language, learn a new technology, etc. You have to work through it and give yourself a win to realize that you are a good developer with your own strengths and you shouldn\'t compare yourself to others. In the end you have to realize that while there are better developers than you out there, they are not you. You have your own unique skill set that you bring to the table that nobody else can.</p>\n',coverImage:{type:"image",mimeType:"image/jpeg",src:"/assets/static/dealing-with-imposter-syndrome.07cc2b7.d55486d.jpg",size:{width:860,height:573},sizes:"(max-width: 860px) 100vw, 860px",srcset:["/assets/static/dealing-with-imposter-syndrome.a67b0b2.d55486d.jpg 480w","/assets/static/dealing-with-imposter-syndrome.07cc2b7.d55486d.jpg 860w"],dataUri:"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 860 573' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-42'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='10'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-42)' width='860' height='573' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%2c/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAArAEADASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwABAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAcFBv/EACYQAAEDBAAGAgMAAAAAAAAAAAEAAgMEBREhBgciMUFhEhMlcYH/xAAWAQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQL/xAAYEQEBAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARECcf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8Ai6Iiy2IipfKK22%2brmey5tjY6d3xifI3IJH6OQPZGFLcX1NEXdc1rTR268/j3wvaOmQx9O/GBnJGjsaXCpLqCIioIiIGcKvctLjaavg2ut9eWw1cL8skbGXuLS4EaAJIz4CktPL9UofgHxsZXU8vaJk/EElbLUOgobfG6pndG8sc5oGmA99nR9JjPVxt8wYoKfhyENgZ8JKp5pXyNxMGHrId6AcBhTda3Ed8qr9XGpq3EgZETOwjbknAH9WSpGoIiKgiIgLUsVWaY1zAQPvpnR787BWWgOOyJZswRERRERB//2Q==' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"}}}}}}]);
