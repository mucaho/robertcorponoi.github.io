However, after work we can freely write CSS with <code class=\"language-text\">!important</code> everywhere and Typescript with <code class=\"language-text\">any</code> for all types (please don't actually do these things). However, the problem is (if you're like me at all) that you tend to think big and you might start a decently sized project in your free time. You start working on it every day after work and before you know it it's Sunday night and you've managed to finally finish the <code class=\"language-text\">package.json</code> (but we all know you're going to edit the desecription a hundred more times). This is a position I have been in many times and it can lead to your work and personal life taking a hit because you don't have the energy that you could since you have to spent some of it at work and the rest at home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whats-the-balance\"><a href=\"#whats-the-balance\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>What's The Balance?</h2>\n<p>To be completely honest I still haven't figured it out. Well it's not that I don't know what the balance is because I think I do, but it's that I have trouble implementing it. In an ideal world I would go to work, come home, work on a fun side project for an hour or two and then relax. However in my current world I go to work, come home, and work until around 11pm or when I fall alseep, whichever comes first.</p>\n<p>There's a few different problems that lead to this happening, some are within my control while others are not. One thing I can control is the scope of the project that I assign to myself. I always have grand ideas about what I want to create and I don't think that's bad, however, I allot a small time frame for when I want to have the project completed and so it leads to me overworking myself and in the end I usually still don't meet my self-imposed deadline since it was impractical to begin with. One thing that is out of your control is just the sheer length it takes to complete most projects. Even with personal projects you usually experience the scope changing and having to do more work and then there's trial and error and testing and by the end I've spent a week just planning and setting it up.</p>\n<p>Another big problem I have is that if I don't spend a significant amount of time working on projects in free time I feel bad about it. I feel like I'm not doing anything and I'm a lazy developer and I'm going to fall behind in the world because I took a night off and watched The Office instead of writing console.log statements. This part ties in with my post on dealing with imposter syndrome and ultimately it comes down to things that make me feel like I'm not a good developer or I'm not as good as I should be. I know that through other people speaking out about it that it's pretty much false and it's just self-inflicted criticism but it's hard to just shrug off.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-can-you-do-about-it\"><a href=\"#what-can-you-do-about-it\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>What Can You Do About It?</h2>\n<p>Well again, this is something I still face almost daily but I am actively trying to work on it and here are some steps I have come up with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Set A Time Limit: If you allot yourself say two hours a night to work on a project at home, then you the rest of time after that to relax or go out or do anything other than work. Chances are out the time that you would have spent working probably wouldn't have been that productive in the first place.</li>\n<li>Try To Exercise: No I don't mean go to the gym, I don't even do that. But by exercise I mean take a walk or a jog or even go to the mall and powerwalk. Don't let the old ladies in the neighborhood show you up, show them that your legs haven't atrophied yet from trying to wrangle Webpack.</li>\n<li>Limit Project Scope: This one can be tough but it helps save time and frustration if you limit the scope of the project to something that can be completed within a couple weeks to a month. If you're really keen on doing a large project see if you can make it work as a monorepo so that you can work on the small individual pieces instead of the entire project all at once.</li>\n<li>Take Up Another Hobby: This one is probably one of the harder steps to try but if you, like me, feel that you're being lazy by not working on something after work then something that might help is picking up a another hobby to replace the one you're cutting back on. For me the other hobby became writing posts liek these. I like to think that the experiences I have been through and write about can help someone else and so it fulfills me.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"next-steps\"><a href=\"#next-steps\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Next Steps</h2>\n<p>Speaking from experience, this isn't something that you can just accomplish overnight. It's going to take many days of you cutting back on working outside of work but it doesn't matter as long as you're trying.</p>\n"}}]}}}}}}]);
