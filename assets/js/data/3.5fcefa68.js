We\'ve all been at this point at one time or another in our careers but if you can really say you have not then I\'ll post my resume at the bottom and await your call. But seriously, it\'s a frustrating position to be in because its something you have to do but you might feel like you\'re not learning or using anything that is useful for future endeavors. I\'ve been in this scenario multiple times before and it took me a while to learn how to become content with it and maybe I can help someone else in the same situation. Now of course this advice won\'t apply to every single instance but it might help you see a different point of view.</p>\n<h2 id="meet-the-contenders"><a href="#meet-the-contenders" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Meet The Contenders</h2>\n<p>So in order to make this more personal I\'ll use a personal experience of mine. If you\'ve read or seen any work I\'ve done, you\'ll know I\'m a lover of JavaScript both on the font and back end. On the other end of that, there is my archenemy, PHP. Now before the PHP squad comes after me, I am NOT saying that PHP is a terrible language. I am simply stating that PHP is not a language I like to work with for various reasons. In fact with JavaScript I tend to use TypeScript whenever I can and I feel that PHP isn\'t always strict enough for me but that\'s besides the point. I\'ve written plenty of PHP in my lifetime so far and will continue to write much more because the web is still mostly PHP and that probably won\'t change for a while. I mean heck, if IE can hang on for life for so long anything can.</p>\n<h2 id="different-languages-similar-structure"><a href="#different-languages-similar-structure" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Different Languages, Similar Structure</h2>\n<p>One of the biggest things that I found to help me with this situation might seem obvious but it\'s not always easy to apply, finding a link between the two languages. Put simply, this means that you need to find how doing something in the language you don\'t like (in my case PHP) can help you advance your knowledge for the language/s you do like (in my case JavaScript). For me this became easier with ES6 because of the class syntax with JavaScript so at least I was using OOP in both languages. Another thing for me was strict typing. I became very attached to strict typing in Typescript and had to look up how to apply that in PHP. In PHP strict typing is optional and you have to declare it at the top of the file and even then you don\'t have to specify parameter types but of course I did anyways. PHP is still very much lacking in strict types such as class properties but slowly those features are being added. This is the single biggest tip that I can offer because if you find a way to indirectly advance your knowledge about a language or technology by not working on it you\'ll be much happier with your current situation.</p>\n<h2 id="incorporating-it-into-your-stack"><a href="#incorporating-it-into-your-stack" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Incorporating It Into Your Stack</h2>\n<p>Ok now hear me out, I know this post is about languages and technologies you don\'t enjoy but there is some value to incorporating the said language and technology into your stack. Now the initial benefits to this are almost none, as at this point you still don\'t enjoy it but in the long term you are looking at making yourself a more valuable asset to future employers and in the end making more money. You never know, if you dedicate yourself and learn the nuances of whatever it is you may grow to discover that you like it. I myself am halfway through this step, I realize that a lot of the web still relies on PHP and in some cases it really is a good choice so if I know it I can be a more valuable asset in the future.</p>\n<h2 id="recreate-projects"><a href="#recreate-projects" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Recreate Projects</h2>\n<p>This tip is similar to the first tip but it involves a little bit more work because you have to write something in both languages. Let\'s say that at work I\'m tasked with creating a testing framework in PHP (obviously I would never do because there are already great and reliable open source frameworks available for any language). Now after creating it at work, I go home and work on creating the same thing but in JavaScript. This idea takes something that you made in something you are less comfortable in lets you see how you can do with creating it in a language that is more natural to you. It\'s quite a fun project and I\'ve done before (with JavaScript to Python) and while it\'s technically double the work, you end up with a feeling of satisfaction.</p>\n<h2 id="look-elsewhere"><a href="#look-elsewhere" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Look Elsewhere</h2>\n<p>This is the least recommended step unless you are sure that you have exhausted almost everything you can possibly learn in your current position. If you\'ve been somewhere for less than a year you really should consider one of the methods above and stay for the experience because it will make you more valuable to future employees and you can still learn a lot more. However, in the end this is an option and you could look for other employment using the tech stack that you are comfortable with.</p>\n<h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>In the end it is up to you how you deal with this situation and the above methods are just things that I have found to be useful throughout my career.
